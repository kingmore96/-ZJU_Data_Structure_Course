This is a course-code repository. 

# Info
The Data Structure Course from ZJU is one of the greatest CS fundemental course in China.
I learn this course to strength my skills. 
Hope I can learn this course well and that I can make good performance in my work life.

This is the MOOC website :

This repository is all about my practicing code when learning this course.

## how to use it?
### File name
If the file name starts with **FQ**,this means the question is an function question,
which means you need to write a specific function instead of writing the whole code,
for example the IO code.

If the file name starts with **PQ**,that means it is an programming question,
which means you have to write the whole code including the IO code.

### File inside
You can get the question description on top of the file. See the resource section.
The next code section is my answer,and all of these are pass to the OJ, which means
you can use it directly. And This is my promise to you.

And I make a little bit summary of some questions if I think they are needed.
The summary is writen by Chinese, you can learn Chinese as well if you wish to. :)

## Bye 
haha~
